## ProjectOCR

Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example: from a television broadcast).We use deep neural networks to perform optical character recognition on images captured using a phone, to transcribe text and to extract useful information.

## Datasets: 
COCO-text https://vision.cornell.edu/se3/coco-text-2/, MNIST http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

## Done:

Identified the necessary dataasets, to use for training a neural network.
Extracted and pre-processed the data
Choose a CNN architecture to train the model.

## TODO:

Train a classifier using a CNN to classify text in a image to alphanumeric symbols.
Create a mobile app with a camera to capture images, and detect and recognise if text is present in them.
Extreact text in an image and create a text file containing the digits.
